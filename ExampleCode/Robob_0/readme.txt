Characters:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong Bot	Strong Bot can push objects to make a path.  He also enjoys 			gardening, long walks on the beach, and feeding birds in the park.
Jump Bot	Jumps to heights unreachable by the other bots.  He's also a 3 time 		Orange County high jump champion.
Normal Bot	Despite his name, Normal Bot is anything but.  Other than being the 		only bot that can complete the course, he's able to run faster than the 		other bots.  This is due to his constant training for the Boston 			Marathon.  He has yet to complete it.
